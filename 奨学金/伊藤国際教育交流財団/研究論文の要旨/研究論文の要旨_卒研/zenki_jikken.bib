abstract = {Theoretical expressions are derived for normal-incidence reflectances at three faces of a cube, cut from a triclinic crystal, for any desired orientation of crystallographic axes relative to the cube edges. The reflectances are expressed in terms of the components of the complex dielectric tensor of the crystal referred to the cube axes. Also presented is a suitable dispersion formula in which each component of the dielectric tensor, referred to the fixed cube axes, is given as a sum of the contributions of all crystal oscillators, each multiplied by products of the direction cosines of the oscillator axis relative to the cube axes. A least-squares-fitting procedure, based on the variation of the oscillator parameters and the direction cosines, can be used to obtain the best match of the measured and calculated reflectances, over a wide frequency range, and thereby to determine the dielectric tensor as a function of frequency.},

We used mid-infrared femtosecond pulses to transform one such stripe-ordered compound, nonsuperconducting La1.675Eu0.2Sr0.125CuO4, into a transient three-dimensional superconductor. The emergence of coherent interlayer transport was evidenced by the prompt appearance of a Josephson plasma resonance in the c-axis optical properties. An upper limit for the time scale needed to form the superconducting phase is estimated to be 1 to 2 picoseconds, which is significantly faster than expected. This places stringent new constraints on our understanding of stripe order and its relation to superconductivity.},

Using angle-resolved photoemission and scanning tunneling microscopy, we detect an energy gap at the Fermi surface with magnitude consistent with d-wave symmetry and with linear density of states, vanishing only at four nodal points, even when superconductivity disappears at x =  1/8. Thus, the nonsuperconducting, striped state at x =  1/8 is consistent with a phase-incoherent d-wave superconductor whose Cooper pairs form spin-charge{\textendash}ordered structures instead of becoming superconducting.},
