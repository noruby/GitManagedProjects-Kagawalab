abstract = {Theoretical expressions are derived for normal-incidence reflectances at three faces of a cube, cut from a triclinic crystal, for any desired orientation of crystallographic axes relative to the cube edges. The reflectances are expressed in terms of the components of the complex dielectric tensor of the crystal referred to the cube axes. Also presented is a suitable dispersion formula in which each component of the dielectric tensor, referred to the fixed cube axes, is given as a sum of the contributions of all crystal oscillators, each multiplied by products of the direction cosines of the oscillator axis relative to the cube axes. A least-squares-fitting procedure, based on the variation of the oscillator parameters and the direction cosines, can be used to obtain the best match of the measured and calculated reflectances, over a wide frequency range, and thereby to determine the dielectric tensor as a function of frequency.},

	abstract = {Exploration for superconductivity is one of the research frontiers in condensed matter physics. In strongly correlated electron systems, the emergence of superconductivity is often inhibited by the formation of a thermodynamically more stable magnetic/charge order. Thus, to develop the superconductivity as the thermodynamically most stable state, the free-energy balance between the superconductivity and the competing order has been controlled mainly by changing thermodynamic parameters, such as the physical/chemical pressure and carrier density. However, such a thermodynamic approach may not be the only way to materialize the superconductivity. We present a new kinetic approach to avoiding the competing order and thereby inducing persistent superconductivity. In the transition-metal dichalcogenide IrTe2 as an example, by using current pulse{\textendash}based rapid cooling of up to ~107 K s-1, we successfully kinetically avoid a first-order phase transition to a competing charge order and uncover metastable superconductivity hidden behind. Because the electronic states at low temperatures depend on the history of thermal quenching, electric pulse applications enable nonvolatile and reversible switching of the metastable superconductivity, a unique advantage of the kinetic approach. Thus, our findings provide a new approach to developing and manipulating superconductivity beyond the framework of thermodynamics.},

We used mid-infrared femtosecond pulses to transform one such stripe-ordered compound, nonsuperconducting La1.675Eu0.2Sr0.125CuO4, into a transient three-dimensional superconductor. The emergence of coherent interlayer transport was evidenced by the prompt appearance of a Josephson plasma resonance in the c-axis optical properties. An upper limit for the time scale needed to form the superconducting phase is estimated to be 1 to 2 picoseconds, which is significantly faster than expected. This places stringent new constraints on our understanding of stripe order and its relation to superconductivity.},

It is then shown that the GEM equation quantitatively fits electrical resistivity (conductivity) as a function of the volume fraction data for binary composites. The parameters used to fit the experimental data are the electrical resistivities of the two phases, the percolation threshold for the lower resistivity phase (\UTF{00F4}c), and an exponent t. Preliminary work, showing how the GEM equation can be used to model the piezoresistivity of composites by postulating that \UTF{00F4}c is a function of the independent variable, is also presented.},,

abstract = "The phenomenon of tin pest has been known for hundreds of years. Tin is one of the most common materials used in electronic products and systems. It is found in solders, as a surface finish for printed circuit boards, and as plating for connectors. Tin pest is the formation of tin in the phase of α\UTF{2011}tin, which particularly happens in pure tin that transforms from white β\UTF{2011}tin to gray α\UTF{2011}tin at temperatures below 13.2°C. In this phase, tin is a structurally weak and readily crumbly powder that is not acceptable in electronic systems that must be reliable at low temperatures. Understanding how tin pest occurs is important for evaluating electronic reliability. Although most electrical devices are not exposed to low temperatures for a long period, for many industries, such as automotive (Snow-Cats), telecommunications base stations (cell phone towers), military (weapons systems), space (satellites), and outdoor recreation, the electronics must be reliable at all temperatures. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the tin pest phenomenon research and focuses on new experimental data regarding the formation of tin pest effects. The data presented and analyzed here enable manufacturers to make the right decisions when choosing a tin-based alloy for low-temperature applications. Suggestions on how this information affects the lead-free industry and recommendations for future work to clarify and evaluate the occurrence of tin pest for electronic circuits are presented. Common arguments about the risks of using tin, especially whether tin alloys are acceptable for low-temperature applications and whether lead-free solders should be exempt from regulations, are also discussed. The common assumptions are: (1) lead-free alloys can be safely used in low-temperature applications if solder paste joining technology is used, and (2) joints from solder paste benefit from both the presence of flux residues and tin oxide particles, which combined make the allotropic transformation extremely unlikely. Based on the data discussed in this review, an appendix summarizes the tin-pest-retarding effects on lead-free alloying metals."
