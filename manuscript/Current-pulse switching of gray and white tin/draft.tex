\begin{abstract}
White tin exhibits superconductivity with critical temperature 3.7K while gray tin is semiconducting with the band gap $E_g=0.018eV$.
We demonstrated the reversible transformation between semiconductor-tin (gray tin) and metallic superconductor-tin (white-tin) by applying current pulses.

\section{method}
\subsection{Sample preparation}
Metallic Sn-Ge alloy was converted to semiconductor in a freezer.
Pure Ge-drops (Furuuchi chemical GEM-33001A) were grind, and mixed with pure Sn-drops (Furuuchi chemical SNM-67027A) in a mass ratio1:99 in a quartz tube. The tube was evacuated and heated up to 1050$^\circ$C and cooled slowly in 48 hours in a electric oven. The melted sample were metallic, and we converted to semiconductor phase in a household freezer for a week. 

\subsection{Connections}

\subsection{Resistivity measurement}
The resistivity under slow cooling was measured with the conventional four-probe method. A load resistor of 150 ohms was connected in series with the sample. An AC voltage excitation of 105 Hz with a magnitude corresponding to ? μA was generated at a lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research SR830) and applied to the circuit. Signals from the voltage probes were amplified with a transformer amplifier (Stanford Research SR554) and measured with the lock-in amplifier. The current flowing through the circuit was measured by probing the voltage drop at the load resistor with a multimeter (Keithley 2001).

\subsection{Pulse application}
A rectangular voltage-pulse generated in a source meter (Keithley 2400) was amplified using a precision power amplifier (NF Corporation 4502) by A=100. A load resistor of 5.4 ohms was connected in series with the sample and used to calculate the current flowing through the circuit. The time-varying voltages at the load resistor and the sample voltage-probes were were monitored using a data logger (Measurement Computing DT8824). Thus, we obtained the time profiles of the current and sample resistivity during the pulse application.
